Description: This package combines differential gene expression results. 
    It implements three strategies to summarize gene expression activities from 
    different studies. i) a naive vote-counting approach, ii) a combining-approach
    and iii) Random Effects Model (REM) approach. In all cases, MetaVolcano
    exploits the Volcano plot reasoning to visualize the gene expression
    meta-analysis results.
